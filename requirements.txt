This library will be used for making requests to the API
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!
Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around 30M downloads / week— according to GitHub, Requests is currently depended upon by 1,000,000+ repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.













#The url that we will be using will take this format:
https://api.genderize.io?name={YOUR_NAME}

#The genderize.io website provides a playground where you can test the API.
#The API is free for up to 1000 names/day.

The request will render a response like the following:

{
  "name": "YOUR_NAME",
  "gender": "male",
  "probability": 0.99,
  "count": 165452
}

The probability indicates the certainty of the assigned gender. 
Basically the ratio of male to females. 
The count represents the number of data rows examined in order to calculate the response.

#Batch usage
Checking the gender of multiple names in a request
You can infer the gender of up to 10 names at a time. To do so, send an array of names as the "name" parameter.

https://api.genderize.io/?name[]=peter&name[]=lois&name[]=stevie



#Localization
Classifying genders in the scope of a specific country
Naming conventions can rely heavily on demographics. Therefore, the API accepts an optional "country_id" parameter, for when you have that information. In a lot of cases, this will make the guess more correct.

https://api.genderize.io?name=peter&country_id=US






#Responses & Errors
How to understand your gender checking
All responses wil be in "content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8".
